**What is an SSD?**
A Solid-State Drive (SSD) is a type of non-volatile storage device that stores data on interconnected flash memory chips. Unlike traditional Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), SSDs don't use mechanical parts to read and write data:

1. **Faster Performance**: SSDs can read and write data at incredible speeds, making them much faster than HDDs.
2. **Low Power Consumption**: SSDs use significantly less power than HDDs, which improves battery life in laptops and reduces heat generation**.
3. **Durability**: SSDs are resistant to shock, vibration, and humidity, making them perfect for rugged environments.

**Types of SSDs**:
1. **SATA SSDs**: Use the same interface as traditional HDDs, but with faster speeds (up to 600 MB/s).
2.2 **NVMe SSD**: Uses a newer interface that takes full advantage of SSD capabilities, with speeds up to 3500 MB/s!
3. **PCIe SSDs**: High-end SSDs that use the PCIe interface, capable of reaching speeds of 985 MB/s and beyond!

**Capacity and Cost**:
SSD capacities range from a few hundred gigabytes to several terabytes. Prices vary depending on capacity, brand, and model, but SSDs are generally more expensive than HDDs of similar capacity.

**Benefits**:
1. **Faster Boot Times**: SSDs can boot your operating system'
